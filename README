This webapp was written using MEAN technologies. And it has an easy to use web interface.

The cards.js page is the node script you run to start a working server. All the MongoDB calls are made in this file. There are three separate calls to the db which are called from a http page. The http pages are created using Express. The root page is an unrendered html page which contains all our AngularJS code. The rest of the functions create and deal with the matrix which is inserted into the database. On the front end we have matrix.html. I used a standard set of buttons and a table to display the cards. I was able to color code the cards using ng-if within html as well as ng-repeat to iterate through every row and column. Finally, the Angular Module and Controller made it all possible. I was able to make AJAX calls using Angular and set the results to App based scope variables.

Everything was written on Ubuntu 14.10 and node.js, express, and mongo are all easy to install. Using apt-get you can install most of these programmer interfaces with one line. Angular is used from googleapis. No install is neccecary. Once the rest of the items are installed, run "nodejs ./node/cards.js" with the node folder in your home directory. Mongo can be started using "mongod --dbpath ~/node --port 3001". Once they are started you can, on your browser, go to http://localhost:3000. The app runs from there. Thanks!
